# hello-world

GitHub is kind of the THING that people use. I need to learn and understand this because there are things I want to do that involves using GitHub. Specifically, understanding what I need to do to do a branch to make pieces of software work for openSUSE.

My primary goal is just to understand GitHub, I need to be able to speak the same language as the developers of the projects I enjoy so that I can contribute to something more than documentation. First step, Plasma themes!
